          <li>CSS is used for styling, in simple words for cosmetics or facade of a webpage</li>
          <li>There are three ways to implement CSS code into a website: InLine CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS</li>
          <li>CSS base architecture consists of a Selector, a Property, and a Value</li>
          <li>A Declaration is composed of aProperty and a Value.</li>
          <li>Class Attributes allows the CSS code to be share with any element thus enabling us to choose will be assigned</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

            <li>Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it is using padding and related properties. .</li>
            <li>Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it is using border and related properties.</li>
            <li>Margin box: The area outside the padding and border. It's tranparent.</li>

          <li>Handles logic and allow users to interact with a website which works alongside HTML and CSS.</li>
          <li>Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995.</li>
          <li>It has the ability to incorporate third party libraries.</li>
          <li>It's an Object Base language, but <u>NOT</u> an Object Oriented language.</li>
          <li>Some examples of JavaScript at work are: Forms, Clicking, Pressing Buttons, and Retrieving Data.</li>

          <li style="list-style: none;"><b>BASIC JAVASCRIPT FEATURES</b></li>
          <li><b>Variables:</b> Var is the keyword to decalre a variable in JavaScript. A variable is a container that holds unique information that is assigned to its name uinsg the = sign. A variable can contain different data types.</li>
          <li><b>Data Types:</b> Integer, BigInt, Symbol, Boolean, Null, Undefined, String, Number</li>
          <li><b>Functions:</b> A function is a set of instructions or procedures to perform a specific task</li>
          <li><b>Loops/Iteration:</b> For, Do While, and While loops and others.</li>
          <li><b>Data Structures:</b>a data structure is a format to organize, manage and store data in a way that allows efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data. The four types of basic data structures supported by JavaScript are: array lists, maps, records and JSON tables.</li>
          <li><b>Methods:</b>A Method is a set of instructions that are associated with an object. Example- Console.log.</li>
          <li><b>Arguments -vs- Parameters:</b> Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied. e.g.: Console.log and others.</li>
          <li><b>Conditional Statements:</b>They are features of programming languages that tell the computer to execute certain actions, provided certain conditions are met. Some examples are if/else and true or false.</li>
